These are all plugins I use with ~200 or less stars on GitHub.
- [duplicate.nvim](https://github.com/smjonas/duplicate.nvim): duplication as an *operator*. ([mini.operators](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.operators) also has a multiplication operator which does something similar)
- [scrollEOF](https://github.com/Aasim-A/scrollEOF.nvim): fixes `scrolloff` at the end of a file.
- [highlight-undo](https://github.com/tzachar/highlight-undo.nvim)
- [sibling-swap](https://github.com/Wansmer/sibling-swap.nvim): swap a node with a sibling node. As opposed to the "move argument position" plugins, this works for any type of nodes.
- [text-case.nvim](https://github.com/johmsalas/text-case.nvim) vim.abolish, but for nvim, and also supporting LSP-renaming. e.g. `cRc` to convert all instances of a variable to camelCase
- [regex.nvim](https://github.com/Djancyp/regex.nvim) shows regex matches in a split window. Unmaintained, I use a fork where I fixed 1-2 bugs.
- [codium.nvim](https://github.com/jcdickinson/codeium.nvim) the only AI plugin I actually use.
- [replacer.nvim](https://github.com/gabrielpoca/replacer.nvim) edit your quickfix window like a buffer. On close, all changes across all files are saved. I like this type of cross-file-search-replace best.
